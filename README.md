# Csharp Winform Applications
ThisrRepository contains winform implementations and string methods.
> The most important point to consider when using string methods is that the value we enter into the program and the value we get as output should always be strings.


`Convert.ToInt32()` and `Int32.Parse()` are two functions used to treat the entered string values as numbers.
> When the argument is null, `Int32.Parse()` throws `ArgumentNullException`.

This is the main difference between them.
### Methods and Functions
In Csharp, methods and functions are structures that we write a job we want to do in one go. They are structures that we can do the same job without repeating the code wherever we call them later.

Method use :

```
<visibility> <void> <name>(<parameters>)
{
    <method code>
}
```
Function use :
```
<visibility> <return type> <name>(<parameters>)
{
    <function code>
    return <value>
}
```

> The main difference between method and function is that methods are only responsible for doing the given job; functions return a value at the end of the job.
