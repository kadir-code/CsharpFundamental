# Csharp Winform Applications
ThisrRepository contains winform implementations and string methods.
> The most important point to consider when using string methods is that the value we enter into the program and the value we get as output should always be strings.


`Convert.ToInt32()` and `Int32.Parse()` are two functions used to treat the entered string values as numbers.
> When the argument is null, `Int32.Parse()` throws `ArgumentNullException`.

This is the main difference between them.
